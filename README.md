# Twitter_Facebook_API-s
A) Using Twitter API
Collect at least 10,000 tweets using keywords : #PanamaPapers and #FakeNews (should be
case insensitive). Use twitter search api (REST API) for this. Do the following analysis on both
hashtags separately. 
a) Make separate histograms of top 20 most frequent words in tweets.
b) Make a pie chart to analyze the percentage of tweets from each country.
c) Make a time series graph from your data in which x axis is the time and y axis is number
of tweets tweeted at that time. You can take range of values for x in terms of week or
month.
d) Analyse the data in terms of WHAT these tweet contains. You can present this analysis
in form of pie charts. Example x number of tweets contained images, y number contained
urls etc.
Try to draw inferences from this instead of just reporting graphs and numbers. Compare the
analysis you have drawn from both hashtags.
Note : Make sure you collect only english language tweets. Do not include stop words in your
analysis. Filter out all repetitive tweets.

a) Collect the list of friends of user
i) Make a pie chart of the locations and % of friends belonging to it
ii) Make a pie chart of languages known by friends
iii) Make a time series graph in which x axis is the month and y axis is the number of
friends having their birthday in x month
b) Collect the posts on the timeline of user.

yes, how?

C) Compare Twitter and Facebook API in terms of the Rate Limits and data they let you access.
